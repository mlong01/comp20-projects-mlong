As of now, the game doesn't have any actual gaming functionality.
The sprites are drawn onto the screen; the gameplay will come later.

Initially, I planned on placing the bush/dirt road graphic 30 pixels
above the bottom of the image, and including some element of the
specified #C96A1B color below it to elongate the road, and have the
picture of the dog drawn so it overlaps the element and dirt road
picture. I couldn't get the dog to appear on top of the element, 
so I stuck with just the bush graphic since it does have a decently
sized dirt road that the dog fit on. I also could have just drawn the
dog over the dirt road and not the extra div thing, but I don't
think that's necessarily any better than the current implementation.
I did leave the div tag in the code, the css entry for it in the
file, and the coordinates for the bush and tree graphic if the ground 
div was there, but they're all commented out.I  can just re-implement 
it by uncommenting them.

I spent about 3 hours on this project, and worked the first hour with
Elaine Chestler as we figured out referencing the sprite sheet and
drawing the first element.
