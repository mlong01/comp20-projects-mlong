#####    STATUS_UPDATES README FILE    ######

Hours spent on project: 1.5

Functionality appears to be full - no known major bugs

I worked with Elaine Chestler and Emily Quigley to help
get all the javascript things in the right format. Skyler
Tom also helped us by giving us a helpful resource website
for DOM things (http://www.javascriptkit.com/javatutors/dom2.shtml).

#####           LAB 7 UPDATE           ######

Local storage is now being used to save updates between sessions.
Making the heroku app is a work in progress - I'm in hour four
of trying to debug everything heroku is throwing at me.
Link will be added later.
